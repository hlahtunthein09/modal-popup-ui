âœ¨ Features
Trigger-Based Animation: Modals animate from the button's position using transform-origin, creating a visual link between action and outcome.

Pure CSS Transitions: No external librariesâ€”just clean, performant transitions that respect layout flow.

Responsive Scaling: Typography, modal panels, and controls scale proportionally across viewports.

Accessible Structure: Semantic HTML and keyboard-friendly controls for inclusive UX.

ðŸ§  Design Philosophy
Every interaction is intentional. The modal doesn't just appearâ€”it emerges from the user's action point and gracefully returns when dismissed. This preserves spatial context and reinforces cause-effect clarity in the UI.
